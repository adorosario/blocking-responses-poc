## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-29

### ðŸš€ Major Performance & Configuration Overhaul

#### Critical Performance Improvements (5x Faster Streaming)
- **STREAMING SPEED**: Reduced default `delay_ms` from 250ms to 50ms for dramatically faster response
- **ANALYSIS OPTIMIZATION**: Changed default `analysis_frequency` from 200 to 100 tokens for better balance
- **BUFFER EFFICIENCY**: Only analyze full buffer every 50 tokens instead of every token flush
- **WINDOW ACCURACY**: Fixed fundamental token-based window calculation for precise content display

#### Configuration System Cleanup
- **UNIFIED RISK_THRESHOLD**: Fixed inconsistency (0.7 vs 0.9 vs 1.0) - now unified to 1.0 everywhere
- **COMPLETE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**: Added all missing variables to .env.example with proper defaults
- **DOCKER CONSISTENCY**: Updated docker-compose.yml with complete environment variable set
- **CONFIGURABLE CONSTANTS**: Made all hardcoded performance values configurable

#### Enhanced Detection & Audit Transparency
- **DETAILED PATTERN DETECTION**: Added match positions, weights, and matched text to triggered rules
- **ENHANCED PRESIDIO INTEGRATION**: Added confidence scores and entity positions to audit logs
- **COMPLETE AUDIT LOGGING**: Full forensic information for compliance auditors and reviews
- **UI TRANSPARENCY**: Expandable window text display with detailed incident information

#### Window Analysis Fixes
- **FIXED TOKEN EXTRACTION**: Windows now show exact N tokens that were analyzed (not characters)
- **PROPER BOUNDARIES**: First window starts with response beginning, last window ends with response end
- **ACCURATE DISPLAY**: Token ranges match actual analyzed content (200 tokens = 200 actual tokens)
- **TOKEN ALIGNMENT**: Proper token boundary handling prevents cut-off words

### Added
- **New Environment Variables**: 15+ new configurable settings for performance tuning
- **Enhanced CSS Styling**: Better details/summary element styling with visual indicators

- **Audit Log Detail**: Enhanced triggered_rules with complete Presidio and pattern information
- **UI Details Elements**: Added proper CSS for expandable incident details

### Enhanced
- **Complete Detection Chain**: Both regex patterns and ML entities in audit logs with full context
- **Forensic Positioning**: Exact character positions for compliance evidence and investigation
- **Risk Calculation Transparency**: Individual pattern weights and ML confidence scores visible
- **Decision Auditability**: Clear reasoning for block vs allow decisions with complete data trail

- **LangChain**: For LLM integration and streaming capabilities
- **Pydantic**: For configuration validation and data models
- **Nginx**: For reverse proxy, load balancing, and security headers
- **Docker Compose**: For multi-service orchestration

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: ~150-400ms additional delay for safety buffering
- **Throughput**: Handles concurrent requests with horizontal scaling
- **Memory**: Efficient token buffering with configurable limits
- **CPU**: Optimized regex patterns with minimal overhead

### Security Model
- **Risk Scoring**: Cumulative scoring system with configurable thresholds
- **Pattern Detection**: Comprehensive regex patterns for common PII/sensitive content
